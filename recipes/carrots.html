    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Glazed carrots or candied carrots are a vegetable side dish in Europe and
      the United States made with carrots caramelized in butter and brown sugar,
      sometimes with the addition of an acidic ingredient like orange juice. It
      is considered a traditional food, similar to scalloped potatoes or dinner
      rolls. Some families in the United States serve it as a side for baked ham
      on Easter.

      There are many ways to make glazed carrots. Most recipes for glazed
      carrots will begin by gently pre-cooking the carrots, either by steaming
      or some other method. For the classic recipe, the carrots are cooked in a
      thin butter and sugar syrup. In Europe this version is one of the popular
      vegetable sides for roasted poultry and game meats. In the United States,
      glazed carrots are often served with roast meats of any kind, especially
      Thanksgiving turkey.
